I have followed David, Jason and the other nice people at Basecamp for nearly a decade now. They seem to have found a way that works for working remotely, which is not always easy. A while back [they shared how they are working with Heartbeats](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-tool-we-built-to-keep-everyone-in-the-loop-at-basecamp-69bc58312014), a small tool they built to keep everyone in the loop.
