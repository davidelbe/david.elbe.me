title: About David Elbe
---

I am a web entrepreneur who have been self-employed most of my life. I am building
web applications for a living, mostly in Ruby, Rails and Angular JS - but
I am also happy to learn more about new stuff. However, it is more important to me that
the tool I am using gets the job done, rather than being the cool new shiny thing everyone is talking about.

I am happily married to my beatiful wife Johanna and proud father of my little
daughter Noelle. We live together in a white house in Växjö, Sweden.
