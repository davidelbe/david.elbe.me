<p>
  People have asked for a way to follow me, so in 2014 I started a simple e-mail newsletter. It has been fun. We're a small community of freelancers, consultants and small business owners with one common goal: we all want to grow our business in a smart way.

  Join us and get a weekly newsletter from David in which he helps you grow
  your small freelancing gig to a thriving, profitable agency.
